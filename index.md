## About Me

Hi, everyone! I am Khloe Wright, a rising senior Computer Science major at Howard University. I am originially from Chicago, IL, and I plan to graduate in May 2025. After graduation, I desire to pursue a PhD in computer science, intersecting equity and education with algorithmic structures.

## About My Project

The summer, I have the honor of contributing knowledge and research to The Podcast Project. The Podcast Project focuses on building the capacity for research collaboartions by idenitfying the most salient topics missing from exisiting literature in regards to Black Women in computing. Often in the realm of diveristy and STEM, data focuses on either gender or race, not acknowledging the complexity and the severe effect of the intersection of the two. With this project, we analyze data from Dr. Jeremy Waisome and Dr. Kyla McMullen's riveting podcast, "Modern Figures", a conversational podcast highlights the voices of Black Women in computing, to perform thematic analyses on the experiences of said women.

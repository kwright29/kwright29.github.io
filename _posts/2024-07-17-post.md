title: Using MAXQDA

Date: July 17th, 2024

Now that all of the episodes are transcribed, our team can move on to coding each episode to prepare for our thematic analysis. To get started, all team members participated in doing their own infiducla coding of our first episode, and we will meet with Dr. Waisome to ensure we are coding correctly. Being that this is my first time working with MAXQDA, I was both excited and nervous on how to tackle this portion of the project. I did not want to over "code" the episodes, but I wanted to make sure that my themes for coding each epsidoe were very specific and understandable to somebody that wasn't on the project.

Now, you might be wondering what I mean by "coding" epidoes. MAXQDA is a software program that allows you to analyze qualitiative and mixed methods data for research, academic, and scientific purposes. Since this project deals a lot with text data, we use the method "coding" which assigns codes to text segments. Through these codes, our team will determine the most prominent codes to include in our thematic analysis. 

I'm so excited to discover our finidngs through our process of developing our thematic analysis. I can't wait until I have more information to share!

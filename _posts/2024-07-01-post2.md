title: Thematic Analysis, who?
---

As we get into more of the "meat and potatoes" of the project, I have had the pleasure of learning about the fundamentals of research that will help strengthen our project. Over these few weeks, we have been focusing on literature reviews and thematic analysis. We are using MAXQDA to encode our findings of these analyses. Our process includes transcribing the podcast episodes, encoding the episodes based on themes we found in each one, and meeting with the team to see if our themes align. From there, we will configure a final batch of themes and move on to the next step of the process. 

"Modern Figures" is a profound podcast with a lot of information, and a lot of great guests. That being said, there had to be a process of narrowing down the episodes to ensure that there was precision with the themes. To narrow down the episodes, we first divided the episodes into categories based on the guests that appeared. Some of those categories included: Industry, Academic, Non-Technical, etc. From there, we transcribed the episodes using Rev, and our team personally went through each transcription to ensure accuracy. I'm so excited to continue with this project, and I can't wait to see the knowledge that this research brings into the realm of computing.
